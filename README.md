# CSCD210-Lab7
## Description
The primary focus of this lab is to demonstrate various array manipulation techniques and statistical calculations using Java.
The key components of this repository include:

- Provides a menu-driven program for array operations and statistical calculations.
- Contains methods for creating, filling, adding to, deleting from, and printing arrays.
- Provides methods for computing statistical measures such as mean, median, midpoint, and standard deviation.
- Contains methods for reading user input and displaying the menu.
- Includes a method for sorting arrays using selection sort (provided as a jar file).

## How to Use It
### Setup:
- Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/JosephPotapenko/CSCD210-Lab7.git
- Navigate to the project directory: cd CSCD210-Lab7
### Compile and Run:
- Compile the Java files: javac cscd210lab7/CSCD210Lab7.java
- Run the program: java cscd210lab7.CSCD210Lab7
### Usage:
- The program will prompt you to enter the size of the array and fill it with integers.
- You can then choose from the menu options to perform various operations on the array:
    - Add a number to the array
    - Delete a single value from the array
    - Print the array
    - Compute and display the mean
    - Compute and display the median
    - Compute and display the midpoint
    - Compute and display the standard deviation
    - Exit the program by selecting the option 8.
